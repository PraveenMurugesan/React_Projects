Errors & Fixes

ScrollView Bug
If the scrollview is bouncing then the parent of the scrollview must be added with style flex =1
Eg: 
In the albums project.
Scrollview is in the ListView Component.
The parent of ListView is View in the index.android.js. So the style of that VIEW has flex: 1 

This is one of the minor bugs in react-native. I couldn't see this problem in my implementation. But may help wherever necessary
